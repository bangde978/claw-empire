# Claw-Empire v1.2.0 Release Notes

- Release date: 2026-02-25
- Scope: Agent management (hire/edit/delete), department CRUD, department management tab, DORO character sprite, project-level manual agent assignment, meeting participant filtering for manual projects, mobile-responsive Project Manager, custom skill upload system, bug fixes, and post-release hardening updates merged into v1.2.0.

## Highlights

### Agent Management (CRUD)
- **Hire New Agent** - Full agent creation UI in Agent Manager with name (multilingual: en/ko/ja/zh), department, role (team_leader/senior/junior/intern), CLI provider, sprite number, avatar emoji, and personality fields.
- **Edit Agent** - Inline edit for all agent fields including provider/model reassignment.
- **Delete Agent** - Safe deletion with working-status guard; cascading NULL-ification on tasks, subtasks, meeting minutes, report archives, and review decision states.
- Backend: `POST /api/agents`, `PATCH /api/agents/:id`, `DELETE /api/agents/:id` endpoints with WebSocket broadcast (`agent_created`, `agent_deleted`).

### Department CRUD
- **Create Department** - Full department creation with ID validation (`a-z0-9` pattern), multilingual names, icon, color picker, description, and prompt.
- **Edit Department** - Inline editing of all department properties.
- **Delete Department** - Removal with associated agent/task guards.
- Backend: `POST /api/departments`, `PATCH /api/departments/:id`, `DELETE /api/departments/:id` endpoints with `departments_changed` broadcast.

### Department Management Tab
- Added **subtab toggle** (`Agents | Departments`) inside Agent Manager.
- Department list view with sort order, icon, name, color, agent count, description, and ID.
- **Sort order editing** via arrow buttons and drag-and-drop, with batch save.
- Backend: `PATCH /api/departments/reorder` endpoint using temporary high-value `sort_order` to avoid UNIQUE constraint conflicts during reorder.
- Routing guard added so `/api/departments/reorder` is not captured by `/api/departments/:id`.

### DORO Character Sprite (Sprite #13)
- Added new character **DORO** with full directional sprite set (D-1/D-2/D-3, L-1, R-1).
- Added `scripts/generate-doro-sprites.mjs` for sprite generation pipeline.
- AgentAvatar and OfficeView updated for sprite #13 support.

### Project Manual Agent Assignment
- Projects now support `assignment_mode`: `auto` (default) or `manual`.
- In manual mode, specific agents can be assigned via multi-select checkbox UI with sprite avatar icons and department/role labels.
- New DB schema: `assignment_mode` column on `projects` table + `project_agents` junction table.
- Backend CRUD: `POST /api/projects` and `PATCH /api/projects/:id` accept `assignment_mode` and `agent_ids`.
- `GET /api/projects` and `GET /api/projects/:id` return `assigned_agent_ids` per project.

### Meeting Participant Filtering (Manual Mode)
- When a project uses `assignment_mode: manual`, kickoff and review meetings only include:
  - **Planning team leader** (always included)
  - **Team leaders from departments of the assigned agents**
- `fallbackAll` expansion (invite all active team leaders) is skipped for manual-mode projects.
- Applies to both kickoff (`startPlannedApprovalMeeting`) and review (`startReviewConsensusMeeting`) meetings.

### Task Delegation with Manual Mode
- `findBestSubordinate` in `collab.ts` accepts optional `candidateAgentIds`.
- Manual mode queries `project_agents` and restricts candidates to the assigned agent pool.
- Candidate filtering is additionally constrained to the active team leader's department.
- If no assigned candidate exists for that department in manual mode, fallback to full-department auto selection is blocked.
- Auto mode projects retain existing delegation logic unchanged.

### ChatPanel Manual Mode Indicator
- Project confirm step displays assigned agent count for manual-mode projects (for example: "Manual mode - 2 assigned agents will work on this").

### Mobile-Responsive Project Manager
- **List-detail toggle pattern** for mobile viewports (below `md` / 768px):
  - Project list takes full width when no project is selected.
  - Selecting a project or creating new hides the list and shows detail view.
  - Mobile-only back button returns to project list.
- Desktop layout remains side-by-side.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed project save `500` caused by unresolved `runInTransaction` binding in `core.ts`.
- Improved light-mode error readability in `ProjectManagerModal` (`text-rose-800`/`text-cyan-800` variants).
- Fixed `/api/departments/reorder` save failure caused by route collision with `/api/departments/:id`.
- Added internal scroll behavior for Agent Manager emoji picker (`max-h` + `overflow-y-auto`).
- Added internal scroll behavior for Agent Manager hire/edit modal (`max-h` + `overflow-y-auto`).

### Custom Skill Upload System
- **Custom skill CRUD** — Users can upload `.md` skill files directly through the Skills Library UI, name the skill, select CLI representatives to train, and delete existing custom skills.
- **Classroom training animation** — Uploading a custom skill triggers a full-screen chalkboard classroom animation showing the claw-empire mascot as teacher and CLI representative agents as students.
- **Backend endpoints**: `POST /api/skills/custom` (upload), `GET /api/skills/custom` (list), `DELETE /api/skills/custom/:skillName` (delete) with file-based storage under `custom-skills/` directory and `skill_learning_history` DB records.
- **Frontend API client**: `uploadCustomSkill()`, `getCustomSkills()`, `deleteCustomSkill()` added to `src/api.ts`.
- **Light mode support**: Full light-mode CSS overrides for custom skill buttons, modal, list cards, and classroom animation overlay.

### Post-release Hardening (still v1.2.0)
- **Manual assignment pre-save safeguard modal**: Project Manager now warns when manual assignment is saved with no selected agents or team-leader-only selections, showing selection summary and requiring explicit confirmation.
- **Manual selection visibility**: Manual assignment UI now shows live counts (`total`, `leaders`, `subordinates`) to prevent accidental subordinate omission.
- **Project API `agent_ids` validation**: `POST /api/projects` and `PATCH /api/projects/:id` now validate `agent_ids` type and existence; invalid IDs are rejected with explicit error payloads.
- **Delegation fallback auditability**: In manual mode, when no eligible subordinate exists in assigned candidates, system logs explicit fallback context and sends a CEO-facing safeguard notice before team-leader direct execution.
- **Sprite registration conflict guard**: `POST /api/sprites/register` now returns `409 sprite_number_exists` if target sprite files already exist, preventing accidental overwrite.
- **Portable sprite generation script**: `scripts/generate-doro-sprites.mjs` now resolves output path relative to repository and auto-creates `public/sprites`, removing machine-specific absolute path dependency.
- **Department sort_order UNIQUE index safe migration**: `server-main.ts` now drops and re-creates the `idx_departments_sort_order` UNIQUE index around sort_order seed updates to avoid constraint violations during migration.
